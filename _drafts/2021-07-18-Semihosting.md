# Introduction

Regular readers of my blog posts should know by now that I'm a big fan of adding a small
embedded CPU in my FPGA projects for overall management, 
[bit-banging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging) slow protocols
such as [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IÂ²C), and some real-time operations with not too
stringent timing requirements. They'll also know that the 
[VexRiscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) is the standard soft-core CPU in my
toolbox.

When running code on an embedded CPU, it's very often helpful to have an interface to a
PC to run some kind of console or terminal for control, debugging, and logging. A UART is obviously
very popular for this, but I often also use a [JTAG UART](2021/05/02/Intel-JTAG-UART.html), 
which can be easier to integrate if you already have a JTAG connection to for FPGA for 
other reasons.

But there's another option that many probably have never heard about. Instead of using
a dedicated HW block, it leverages the existing debug infrastructure of the CPU by adding a
peculiar software layer on top of the low level debug driver. 

It's called semihosting, and it allows the embedded CPU use the host PC as a server
for a variety of functions: STDIO read and write, access to the PC file system, time 
server etc.

Semihosting is definitely a bit of a hack, but it's a clever one, and I think there's 
something magical about a slow embedded CPU with 4KB of RAM commandeering a mighty
PC into reading and writing files on its file system.

# Semihosting and RISC-V

Semihosting is nothing new: I first used it in 1995 on a prehistoric ARM7TDMI CPU
that was embedded in the 
[Alcatel MTC-20276](http://static6.arrow.com/aropdfconversion/467166f711419cfece3c159c1fd6c2fc98bf586c/mtc-20276.pdf), 
an [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network) ASIC that was 
going to take over the world... 

![ISDN chip with ARM7TDMI](/assets/semihosting/isdn_chip.png)

It did not take over the world at all, but it was great for our potential customers because
it gave them leverage over their existing ISDN chip supplier to lower their prices.

I remember semihosting to be very useful to observe various line state changes or to figure 
out when and why some echo cancellation filter was going off the rails.

*You're absolutely right to question the relevance of a 1995 ISDN chip in a 2021
blog post about semihosting, but it's just a wave of nostaligia crashing over me, and
it's not as if you can do anything about it.*

The point is: ARM invented semihosting at least 26 years ago.

Let's have a look to the [ARM semihosting specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100863/latest)
to see what it's really all about:

> Semihosting is a mechanism that enables code running on an ARM target or emulator 
> to communicate with and use the Input/Output facilities on a host computer. The host 
> must be running the emulator, or a debugger that is attached to the ARM target.

Semihosting is a powerful feature, because it can give a tiny embedded CPU that doesn't have any
generic IO capabilities to do things like accepting keystrokes, print out debug information to a debug
console, or even read and write from and to a file on the host PC.  It's up to the external debugger 
(OpenOCD in our case) to intercept a semihosting operation request from embedded CPU and perform the requested action.

The performance of semihosting commands is subject to the bandwidth of the communication interface
by which the embedded CPU is connected to the host PC. Most of the time, this will be JTAG,
so don't expect miracles!

Despite having existed for so long, I'm not aware of any other CPU family that has support for 
semihosting (I definitely can't find anything in the OpenOCD source code), except for RISC-V. In their
discussion of the EBREAK instruction (section 2.8 of the RISC-V Instruction Set Manual), semihosting
is only mentioned as a large-ish footnote, but that's sufficient because other than defining the 
RISC-V specific semihosting function call semantics, RISC-V simply adopted the ARM semihosting specification.
Smart!

OpenOCD refactored the ARM semihosting support code into 
[`semihosting_common`](https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd/blob/master/src/target/semihosting_common.h) which
is CPU family agnostic, making it easy to add semihosting support to RISC-V targets. Both the
[official OpenOCD repo](https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd/blob/master/src/target/riscv/riscv_semihosting.c) and
the [custom OpenOCD version for the VexRiscv CPU](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv/blob/f8c1c8ad9cd844a068a749532cfbc369e66a18f9/src/target/vexriscv.c#L143-L150)
support semihosting.

# Semihosting Functionality

Exactly what kind of features does semihosting offer?

The spec defines 24 function calls that can be put in the following categories:

| Category | Calls | Description |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Time keeping | `SYS_CLOCK`  `SYS_ELAPSED`  `SYS_TICKFREQ`  `SYS_TIME` | The embedded CPU can ask the host for a time reference in case it doesn't have one.  Since communication usually happens over JTAG, the time accuracy won't be very high. |
|File IO | `SYS_OPEN`, `SYS_READ`, `SYS_CLOSE`, `SYS_FLEN`, `SYS_SEEK`, `SYS_WRITE`, `SYS_ISTTY`, `SYS_REMOVE`, `SYS_RENAME`, `SYS_TMPNAM` | All kinds of transactions on files that live on the host PC file system. | 
| Console IO | `SYS_READC`, `SYS_WRITEC`, `SYS_WRITE0` | The console IO (also called the debug channel) is the equivalent of a UART or JTAG UART. |
| System commands | `SYS_SYSTEM` | Allow the embedded CPU to execute operating system commands on the host PC. Things like `pwd` or `mkdir`. Or even `/bin/rm -fr /`, because why not? | 
| Program control | `SYS_EXIT`, `SYS_EXIT_EXTENDED`, `SYS_GET_CMDLINE` | Some functions to pass command line parameters to the embedded firmware, or to feed back-end with execution status and error conditions. |
| Status | `SYS_HEAPINFO`, `SYS_ISERROR`, `SYS_ERRNO` | Some functions to report back memory status of the embedded CPU or the status of earlier semihosting function calls. |


The specification assigns a 
[unique number](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv/blob/f8c1c8ad9cd844a068a749532cfbc369e66a18f9/src/target/semihosting_common.h#L53-L76)
to each semihosting function call. 

In case it wasn't obvious: when enabled and left unchecked, semihosting offers the embedded CPU
an almost unlimited supply of opportunities to kill the host PC. The only things that prevent
an embedded CPU from deleting all files on a file system are carefull permission management
of the debug server and the `arm semihosting enable` command in OpenOCD.

# Semihosting Under the Hood

So how does semihosting work?

It's built on top of software breakpoints that are traditionally used to halt a CPU while debugging:

1. The semihosting call that runs on the embedded CPU has a RISC-V `EBREAK` instruction
  that halts the CPU when a debugger is connected.
1. The host PC continuously polls the embedded CPU to check if it is halted.
1. When a halt is detected, the host PC checks if the `EBREAK` instruction is part of the following
  magic instruction sequence:

    ```
SLLI    x0, x0, 0x1f
EBREAK
SRAI    x0, x0, 0x07
    ```

    *The first and third instructions are dummies that don't do anything, because they use x0 as the 
    destination register. No sane compiler would ever generate this code sequence.*

    Here's the 
    [instruction sequence detection code](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv/blob/f8c1c8ad9cd844a068a749532cfbc369e66a18f9/src/target/vexriscv.c#L853-L870)
    on the VexRiscv version of OpenOCD.

1. If the sequence is detected, the debugger treats the `EBREAK` as a semihosting call. 

    The value of register `a0` contains the semihosting system call number (one of the SYS_* above), and register
    `a1` contains the system call parameter. 

    Semihosting calls can only pass 1 parameter through a register. However, for system calls that need to pass
    multiple pieces of data to the debugging host, the `a1` register will be a pointer to a struct, located
    in the embedded CPU data memory, with further information.
    The debugging host gets the contents of the struct by issuing memory read commands with the same mechanism 
    that's normally used to access memory during regular debugging operations.

1. The debugging host, OpenOCD, executes the requested semihosting system call.
1. Upon completion, the debugging host stores the return value in register *a0*. 
1. The debugging host unhalts the embedded CPU. 

If the embedded CPU was halted without seeing that magic semihosting instruction sequence, then there 
must have been another reason for the halt. E.g. it might be caused by a regular software breakpoint, or
the firmware ran into some error condition and issued the `EBREAK`.

# Semihosting Library

The embedded CPU typically has a C library that wraps the semihosting calls into familiar C functions such 
as `printf()`, `fclose()`, `putchar()` etc.,

There is no need to implement all semihosting function calls in that embedded CPU library: in many cases, 
print related functions will be sufficient to output debug messages. Add a variant of `getchar()` and 
there's enough for a simple embedded terminal.
