*Executive Summary: in keeping with [Betteridge's Law of Headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines),
it didn't work...*

During time well spent at the <...> workshop at the Hackaday Supercon, I learned about the existence of 
[3M Electrically Conductive Adhesive Transfer Tape 9703](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/search/?Ntt=9703), better
known as Z-tape.

Z-tape is like your garden variety double-sized tape to glue to surfaces together, but with a twist: it's a conductor, 
but current can only flow through tape (the Z axis), but not laterally. 

The [3M datasheet](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/66235O/3m-electrically-conductive-adhesive-transfer-tape-9703.pdf) 
explains very well how it works: 

> [Z-tape] is a pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA) transfer tape with anisotropic electrical conductivity. The PSA matrix
> is filled with conductive particles which allow interconnection between substrates through the adhesive thickness 
> (the “Z-axis”) but are spaced far enough apart for the product to be electrically insulating in the plane of the adhesive.

Thanks to Z-tape, you can join together flat surfaces while creating an electrical connection as well. 

Z-tape sees heavy use in the LCD panels where flex cables are glued straight onto the glass without needing a connector.

While it has seen some use in the [hobby electronics circuit](https://chibitronics.com/), it's not very popular due to its 
high cost. Adafruit charges a [$5](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1656) for a 5cm by 15cm sheet. Amazon is slightly
cheaper. Eager to try out it out just for the sake of it, I spent $5 for 15 4" by 0.75" sheets.

The next day, this arrived at my front door:

# The Experiment


With my hammer in hand, the search was on for a suitable nail. And I didn't have to look hard to find the perfect candidate: 
The [Cisco HWIC-3G-CDMA PCB](/2019/11/10/Cisco-HWIC-3G-CDMA.html) that I just finished reverse engineering has an unused 
TSOP-48 footprint and connections from that footprint to the Cyclone II FPGA that leave now doubt about its original 
purpose: a NOR flash.

![NOR Flash Footprint]({{ "/assets/z-tape/nor_flash_footprint.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Would it be possible to upgrade this board with NOR flash without needing a soldering iron, hot-air rework stations, or reflow 
toaster oven?

![Z-tape Electrical Properties]({{ "/assets/z-tape/z-tape_electrical_properties.png" | absolute_url }})

A closer look at the 3M datasheet (after the good had already arrived, of course) lists a minimum separation of 0.4mm 
between conductors. With one pin spacing of 0.5mm, we should be good on that. 

![NOR Flash Package]({{ "/assets/z-tape/nor_flash_package.png" | absolute_url }})

But the minimum required overlap between conductors that need to be bonded together is 3.2mm2. The pins of a TSOP-48 package are
just 0.5mm long and only 0.2mm wide, good for a surface area of 0.1mm2, only 30 times smaller than recommended. 

In addition, the flat part of these pins might not be fully horizontal, possibly reducing the chance of a good connection 
even more.

The odds were not in my favor, but worst case, I'd be out $5 on the tape, and have to solder the NOR flash instead of tape it, 
like a peasant.

# Z-Tape Application and NOR Flash Installation

Z-tape is an adhesive transfer tape. With regular tape, like Scotch tape, the plastic strip remains after application, it's
one of the major factors that provides strength. The purpose of the strip of transfer tape is one of a carrier of glue, and
helping with applying this glue in a thin, uniform layer, after which the strip is removed.

To apply Z-tape, you remove the protective layer, and press the now exposed sticky part onto the surface that you want
to connect (the PCB.)

After that, you need to carefully peel the other protective layer away, while making sure that you don't rip the glue layer
from the PCB. Sharp tweezers were essential to get a grip on that second protective layer.

Here you see now the top row has the second layer already removed, while it's still there for the bottom part.

With the protective layers remove, it's time to install the NOR flash:

![NOR Flash Next to Footprint]({{ "/assets/z-tape/nor_flash_next_to_footprint.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Getting all the pins of the NOR flash right on top of the solder pads was a challenge. I need a microscope to see what
I'm doing, but that too zoomed in have an overview of the full chip. Eventually, I was able to make it work:

![NOR Flash Installed]({{ "/assets/z-tape/nor_flash_installed.jpg" | absolute_url }})

After installing the flash, I squeeze on the flash to make sure there was good contact between all pins, PCB, and
Z particles, while make sure that I wouldn't push the pins off the solder pads.

# Z-Tape Particles Up Close

With the NOR flash pins, spaced apart 0.5mm from each other, as reference, we can get a better idea about the size and
density of the Z particles themselves: their spacing is around 0.1mm, and their typical size about 0.05m.

![Z Particles Up Close]({{ "/assets/z-tape/z_particles_up_close.jpg" | absolute_url }})

This made me somewhat hopefull about still pulling things off: it should be possible to get at least one or two grains
per pin?

However, when you look at the NOR flash pins, you see how small the active area of each pin really is:

![NOR Flash Pins Closeup]({{ "/assets/z-tape/nor_flash_pins_closeup.jpg" | absolute_url }})

*In the picture above, you see that the film isn't very smooth anymore around the pins: that's because I had to tear away
some film to expose a testpoints needed to measure the contact between the pins and the PCB. It shouldn't have made an impact
on the part of the film that was squeezed between the pin and the solder pad. (And, indeed, there was no material difference
in results between that row and the other one, which didn't require remove part of the film.)*

# The Result

Time to bring out the multimeter, and check if there was a connection between pin and PCB.

The result: not good. Or better: terrible. I measured around 40 pins, and only around 5 pins were successfully connected
to the PCB.

One thing that I didn't realize ealier was the the solder pads had solder on them, making their surface round instead of flat.
With a flat-on-flat connection, the overlapping surface area was already 30 times smaller than required, these round
bumps made the effective overlapping surface even smaller.

This experiment was doomed to fail right from the start. :-)
